## 1. Project Identity

**Tritium-Edge** is a **Software Defined IoT** platform for managing
heterogeneous edge device fleets. The same management server handles ESP32
microcontrollers, STM32 sensor nodes, ARM Linux SBCs, and any future hardware
family that speaks the heartbeat protocol. Devices self-describe their
capabilities; the server adapts.

ESP32-S3 Waveshare development boards are the **first hardware family** -- six
boards spanning AMOLED QSPI, LCD QSPI, and RGB parallel display technologies.
The management server handles fleet-scale device operations: provisioning, OTA
updates, remote configuration, monitoring, and multi-tenant organization.

Peripheral drivers (sensors, codecs, displays, I/O expanders) are written once
in platform-agnostic C and shared across hardware families. A thin Platform
Abstraction Layer (PAL) isolates chip-specific APIs (I2C, GPIO, networking,
storage) so the same QMI8658 IMU driver works on ESP32 today and STM32
tomorrow. See [HARDWARE-ABSTRACTION.md](HARDWARE-ABSTRACTION.md) for the full
multi-family design.

The project follows the patterns established by **tritium-sc**: modular
`src/` layout with engine and domain packages, Pydantic settings, loguru
logging, router-per-domain FastAPI architecture, CYBERCORE neon UI aesthetic,
vanilla JS frontend, TDD with tiered test suites, and shell-script entry
points.

### Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Software Defined IoT | Same hardware, different behavior. Product profiles define what a device does. Change the profile, change the device. No reflash needed for config changes. |
| Multi-family hardware | Three-layer abstraction: PAL (chip-specific), Drivers (peripheral-specific, shared), BSP (board-specific pin maps). Write a sensor driver once, use it everywhere. |
| Compile-time hardware selection | Board and app chosen via `-DBOARD_*` / `-DAPP_*` build flags. Zero runtime dispatch overhead. |
| Capability-driven UI | Devices report capabilities in heartbeat. Server shows relevant config options. No camera settings for a temperature node. |
| HAL abstraction | Each peripheral gets a self-contained library under `lib/hal_*`. Dual-mode I2C supports both Arduino Wire and LovyanGFX backends. |
| Server modularity | One router per domain, services for business logic, store for persistence. No monoliths. |
| Multi-tenant first | Organizations, users, roles, and device scoping baked into the data model from the start. |
| Config-as-code | Pydantic settings with environment variable overrides. No magic config files. |
| CYBERCORE aesthetic | Cyan `#00f0ff`, magenta `#ff2a6d`, green `#05ffa1`, yellow `#fcee0a`. No frontend frameworks. |
| Transport agnostic | The mesh communicates through *any* available channel. WiFi, BLE, LoRa, ESP-NOW, 4G, Zigbee, sound, light — if it can carry bits, it's a transport. |
| Self-replicating | Every node carries what fits — its own firmware, its family's firmware, or the whole ecosystem. Nodes seed new nodes. The mesh grows itself. |
| AGPL-3.0 by design | The license reinforces the architecture. Code must remain open. Improvements are shared. The mesh spreads, and so does the source. |

### Self-Replication: Every Node is a Seed

What a node can **compute** and what it can **carry** are independent. A node's
replication role depends on its storage, not its processing power.

| Tier | Storage | Carries | Role |
|------|---------|---------|------|
| **Minimal** | 16-24MB flash | Own firmware + config | Leaf — receives updates, carries itself |
| **Light** | 1-4GB flash/SD | Firmware for its hardware family | Relay — passes firmware to its neighbors |
| **Vault** | 32-256GB SD | Multi-family firmware, models, configs, docs | Seed — bootstraps new nodes from any family |
| **Full mirror** | SSD/NVMe | Everything | Mirror — complete ecosystem replica, seeds anything |

A solar-powered ESP32 with a 128GB SD card can't run a vision model, but it
**carries** that model. When a Jetson joins the mesh, the ESP32 seeds it —
even over slow Bluetooth. The Jetson boots, loads the model, and starts
inference. The ESP32 made that possible without running a single GPU cycle.

**Implementation impact on tritium-edge:**

- `hal_sdcard` already supports high-capacity SDMMC. Vault functionality
  builds on this with a structured layout: `sd:/tritium/firmware/`,
  `sd:/tritium/models/`, `sd:/tritium/config/`, `sd:/tritium/src/`.
- `hal_provision` gains a `seed_from_peer()` function — receive ecosystem
  data from any available transport.
- `hal_ota` gains `serve_firmware()` — make stored firmware available to
  peers requesting it over ESP-NOW, BLE, or WiFi.
- The heartbeat reports a `storage_tier` field so the server knows each
  node's replication capability.
- Vault inventory (what firmware/models a node carries) is published to
  `tritium/{site}/mesh/{device_id}/inventory`.

The replication is opportunistic. Nodes don't push everything everywhere —
they advertise what they have, and peers pull what they need. Background
sync fills vaults incrementally when bandwidth is available.

**Blind courier storage:** Nodes with spare capacity can store encrypted
data for the mesh without being able to read it. A desktop with 2TB free
holds encrypted model weights or firmware archives. It can't decrypt them.
When another node needs the data, it pulls and decrypts locally. If the
courier needs space, it evicts the oldest chunks and the mesh re-replicates
them to other nodes with free capacity.

- Each chunk is AES-256 encrypted by the source node before distribution.
- Chunk metadata (hash, size, owner, replica count) is stored in cleartext
  so the mesh can track what's where without exposing content.
- The heartbeat reports `free_storage` so the server can identify courier
  candidates.
- Eviction is graceful: the courier announces eviction intent, the mesh
  finds alternative hosts, then the chunk is released.
- Minimum replica count (default: 2) ensures no data is lost on eviction.
- Published to `tritium/{site}/mesh/{device_id}/storage` (capacity,
  chunks held, eviction queue).

### Communications Philosophy: Every Channel is a Transport

Tritium treats communication as a **multi-modal, opportunistic mesh**. The system
does not privilege any single radio or protocol. Every available channel — whether
it's a purpose-built radio or an improvised signaling path — is a potential
transport for the feedback loop.

**Purpose-built transports** (first-class drivers):

| Transport | Range | Bandwidth | HAL | Use Case |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-----|----------|
| WiFi (802.11) | ~100m | High | hal_wifi | Primary data, OTA, streaming |
| BLE 5.0 | ~50m | Medium | hal_ble | Provisioning, short-range mesh |
| ESP-NOW | ~200m | Low-Medium | hal_espnow | Low-latency mesh, no AP needed |
| LoRa | 2-15km | Very Low | future | Long-range telemetry, alerts |
| Zigbee | ~100m | Low | future | Sensor mesh, home automation |
| 4G/LTE | Cellular | High | future | WAN backhaul, remote sites |
| Ethernet | Local | Very High | future | Fixed nodes, servers, gateways |
| Meshtastic | 2-15km | Very Low | future | Community LoRa mesh relay |
| Tailscale | Internet | High | future | Secure WAN overlay (servers, SBCs) |

**Improvised transports** (the mesh finds a way):

| Channel | Encoding | Sensor | Bandwidth | Use Case |
|---------|----------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Speaker → Microphone | FSK/DTMF audio tones | hal_audio | ~100 bps | Acoustic data link, air-gapped relay |
| LED/Display → Camera | Flashing patterns, QR codes | hal_camera | ~10-1000 bps | Visual data link, optical relay |
| IR LED → IR receiver | Modulated IR | future | ~1 kbps | Line-of-sight covert channel |
| Vibration motor → IMU | Encoded vibration patterns | hal_imu | ~1-10 bps | Contact-based data transfer |

The principle: **if a device has an output and another device has a matching
sensor, that's a communication channel.** A speaker and a microphone are a
modem. A flashing screen and a camera are a fiber-optic link without the fiber.
An IMU pressed against a vibrating motor is a telegraph.

> *"Life finds a way."* — And so will Tritium.

This is cybernetics in its purest form — the feedback loop doesn't care about
the medium. The mesh degrades gracefully across transport failures by falling
back to whatever channel is available. A node that loses WiFi can still relay
through ESP-NOW. If radio is jammed, it can encode data as audio tones or
visual patterns. The mesh finds a way.

#### Transport Abstraction Layer

All transports present a unified interface to the mesh:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    MESH ROUTING LAYER                     │
│  Destination-based routing, transport selection,          │
│  multi-path redundancy, store-and-forward                 │
├──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────────┤
│  WiFi    │  BLE     │  ESP-NOW │  LoRa    │  Improvised  │
│  MQTT    │  GATT    │  Flood   │  Mesh    │  Audio/Vis   │
│          │          │  P2P     │  tastic  │  IR/Vibrate  │
├──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────────┤
│                  TRANSPORT ABSTRACTION                     │
│  send(dest, payload, priority, constraints)               │
│  recv() → (source, payload, transport, rssi)              │
│  available_transports() → [{type, quality, bandwidth}]    │
│  on_transport_change(callback)                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each transport driver implements:
- **send(dest, payload)** — transmit to a peer or broadcast
- **recv(callback)** — receive incoming data
- **quality()** — current link quality (RSSI, loss rate, latency)
- **bandwidth()** — estimated throughput in bytes/sec
- **available()** — whether the transport is currently usable

The routing layer selects transports based on message priority, payload size,
and available channel quality. High-priority alerts use the fastest available
path. Large payloads (OTA, camera frames) prefer high-bandwidth channels.
Telemetry and heartbeats can use any channel, including low-bandwidth ones.

#### Multi-Path Mesh Topology

```
Node A ──WiFi──── Node B ──LoRa───── Node D
  │                 │                   │
  │ ESP-NOW         │ BLE               │ Audio
  │                 │                   │ (speaker→mic)
  v                 v                   v
Node C ──────────────────────────── Node E
         (visual: LED flash→camera)
```

Any node can reach any other node through multiple independent paths. The mesh
maintains a **transport topology map** — each node advertises which transports
it has and what peers it can reach through each one. Routing decisions happen
per-message, adapting in real-time to transport availability.

When a primary transport fails, the mesh **automatically falls back** to the
next available channel without application-layer awareness. The heartbeat
protocol, command delivery, and telemetry all work identically regardless of
the underlying transport.

#### MQTT Topic Convention for Transports

Transport status is published to the mesh via MQTT (or relayed through
whatever transport is available):

```
tritium/{site}/mesh/{device_id}/transports    ← Available transports + quality
tritium/{site}/mesh/{device_id}/peers         ← Reachable peers per transport
tritium/{site}/mesh/{device_id}/routing       ← Current routing table
```

This feeds into tritium-sc's situational awareness — the Command Center can
visualize the mesh topology, see which links are active, and understand the
communication health of the entire fleet.

## 3. Repository Structure (Target)

The repository serves two codebases: the **Python management server** and the
**C++ ESP32 firmware**. During the transition period, server code lives in
`server/`. The target layout moves server code to `src/` and firmware to
`firmware/`.

### Current Layout (Transition)

## 5. Authentication and Authorization

### Token Types

| Token | Lifetime | Audience | Use Case |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| Access token | 15 minutes | Admin portal, API clients | Short-lived, carries user identity + org + role |
| Refresh token | 7 days | Admin portal | Silent re-authentication, rotated on use |
| Device token | 365 days | ESP32 devices | Issued during provisioning, scoped to one device |
| API key | No expiry | Scripts, CI/CD | Backward-compatible fallback, stored in `.api_key` |

### JWT Payload (Access Token)

```json
{
  "sub": "user-abc123",
  "email": "alice@acme.com",
  "org_id": "acme-corp",
  "role": "org_admin",
  "iat": 1741305600,
  "exp": 1741306500,
  "type": "access"
}
```

### JWT Payload (Device Token)

```json
{
  "sub": "esp32-a1b2c3d4e5f6",
  "org_id": "acme-corp",
  "type": "device",
  "iat": 1741305600,
  "exp": 1772841600
}
```

### Auth Flow

```
1. User Login
   POST /api/auth/login {email, password}
   -> Verify bcrypt hash
   -> Return {access_token, refresh_token}

2. API Request
   GET /api/devices  (Authorization: Bearer <access_token>)
   -> Middleware decodes JWT
   -> Checks role against endpoint requirements
   -> Injects user context into request state

3. Token Refresh
   POST /api/auth/refresh {refresh_token}
   -> Verify refresh token validity
   -> Issue new access_token + rotated refresh_token

4. Device Heartbeat
   POST /api/devices/{id}/status  (Authorization: Bearer <device_token>)
   -> Middleware decodes device JWT
   -> Validates device_id matches token subject
   -> Scopes data access to token org_id

5. API Key Fallback (Migration Period)
   GET /api/devices  (X-API-Key: <key>)
   -> Middleware checks against stored API key
   -> Grants super_admin equivalent access
   -> Deprecated: log warning, encourage JWT migration
```

### Endpoint Authorization Matrix

| Endpoint | `super_admin` | `org_admin` | `user` | Device Token | API Key |
|----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `GET /api/orgs` | Y | own | -- | -- | Y |
| `POST /api/orgs` | Y | -- | -- | -- | Y |
| `GET /api/devices` | Y | own org | own org | -- | Y |
| `POST /api/devices/{id}/status` | -- | -- | -- | Y (self) | -- |
| `POST /api/ota/push/{id}` | Y | own org | -- | -- | Y |
| `POST /api/firmware/upload` | Y | own org | -- | -- | Y |
| `GET /api/users` | Y | own org | -- | -- | Y |
| `POST /api/commands/{id}` | Y | own org | limited | -- | Y |

## 6. Heartbeat Protocol v2

### Request Payload

The heartbeat is the primary device-to-server communication channel. Devices
POST to `/api/devices/{device_id}/status` on a configurable interval (default
60 seconds).

```json
{
  "version": "1.3.0",
  "board": "touch-lcd-349",
  "partition": "ota_0",
  "ip": "192.168.1.42",
  "mac": "20:6E:F1:9A:24:E8",
  "uptime_s": 7200,
  "free_heap": 245760,
  "rssi": -48,
  "fw_hash": "a1b2c3d4...64-char-sha256",

  "reported_config": {
    "heartbeat_interval_s": 60,
    "display_brightness": 80,
    "wifi_networks": ["HomeNet"],
    "ntp_server": "pool.ntp.org",
    "sleep_schedule": null,
    "enabled_modules": ["wifi", "display", "touch", "imu"]
  },

  "module_status": {
    "wifi": {"state": "connected", "rssi": -48},
    "display": {"state": "active", "driver": "AXS15231B"},
    "touch": {"state": "active", "driver": "AXS15231B"},
    "imu": {"state": "active", "accel_range": "4g"},
    "camera": {"state": "disabled"},
    "audio": {"state": "error", "error": "ES8311 init failed"}
  },

  "ota_result": {
    "status": "success",
    "version": "1.3.0",
    "error": ""
  }
}
```

All fields are optional. Devices send what they have. The server merges
partial updates into the stored device record.

### Response Payload

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "server_time": "2026-03-07T12:00:00+00:00",

  "desired_config": {
    "heartbeat_interval_s": 30,
    "display_brightness": 100,
    "enabled_modules": ["wifi", "display", "touch", "imu", "camera"]
  },

  "pending_commands": [
    {
      "command_id": "cmd-abc123",
      "type": "gpio_write",
      "params": {"pin": 4, "value": 1},
      "issued_at": "2026-03-07T11:59:00+00:00"
    }
  ],

  "ota": {
    "firmware_id": "fw-def45678",
    "version": "1.4.0",
    "size": 1048576,
    "url": "/api/firmware/fw-def45678/download",
    "scheduled_at": "2026-03-07T12:00:00+00:00"
  }
}
```

### Config Drift Detection

The server computes drift by comparing `reported_config` against
`desired_config` (the effective config from profile defaults merged with
device-level overrides). If any key differs, the full `desired_config` is
included in the heartbeat response.

```
desired_config = merge(profile.default_config, device.config_overrides)

drift = {
    key: desired_config[key]
    for key in desired_config
    if reported_config.get(key) != desired_config[key]
}

if drift:
    response["desired_config"] = desired_config
```

The device applies the desired config and reports the new state on the next
heartbeat. Three consecutive heartbeats with unresolved drift trigger a
`config_drift_alert` event.

### Command Delivery

Commands are queued on the device record and delivered in the heartbeat
response. The device executes each command and reports acknowledgment:

| Command Type | Parameters | Description |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| `reboot` | `{delay_s}` | Schedule device reboot |
| `gpio_write` | `{pin, value}` | Set digital output |
| `gpio_read` | `{pin}` | Read digital input (result in next heartbeat) |
| `pwm` | `{pin, duty, freq}` | Set PWM output |
| `sleep` | `{mode, duration_s}` | Enter light/deep sleep |
| `identify` | `{}` | Flash display or LED for physical identification |
| `diagnostics` | `{modules}` | Run self-test on specified modules |
| `config_reload` | `{}` | Force re-read of NVS config |

Commands include a `command_id` for deduplication and ack tracking. The device
reports `{"command_id": "cmd-abc123", "status": "done", "result": {...}}` in
the next heartbeat.

## 6b. Remote Diagnostics and Fleet Health

Every Tritium node runs a diagnostics subsystem (`hal_diag`) that continuously
monitors hardware health and reports anomalies. This enables remote debugging of
field-deployed devices — understanding LCD failures, chip failures, memory leaks,
power issues, and performance degradation across the entire fleet.

### Health Snapshots

Taken every 30 seconds by default, each snapshot captures:

| Category | Metrics |
|----------|---------|
| **Memory** | Free heap, min heap watermark, free PSRAM, largest free block |
| **Power** | Battery voltage/percent, charge current, power source |
| **Temperature** | CPU internal temp, PMIC temp (AXP2101) |
| **Display** | Init status, FPS, brightness |
| **Connectivity** | WiFi RSSI, connection status, disconnect counter |
| **I2C Bus** | Devices found, error counter (NACK/timeout) |
| **Performance** | Loop time (current/max), uptime, reboot count, reset reason |

### Anomaly Detection

The diagnostics system tracks trends across snapshots and auto-detects:

| Anomaly | Detection | Severity |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Memory Leak** | Heap declining steadily over 10+ snapshots | High |
| **Battery Drain** | Voltage dropping faster than expected discharge curve | Medium |
| **WiFi Degradation** | RSSI declining, increasing disconnects | Medium |
| **Performance Drop** | Loop time increasing, FPS declining | Medium |
| **I2C Failure** | Error counter increasing (chip/bus failure) | High |
| **Display Failure** | FPS drops to 0 or init fails on reboot | Critical |
| **Temperature** | CPU > 80°C or PMIC > 60°C | High |
| **Reboot Loop** | Multiple reboots in short period (tracked via NVS) | Critical |

### Data Flow

```
Node (hal_diag)                Fleet Server                    tritium-sc
  │                               │                               │
  ├─ Heartbeat POST ────────────► POST /api/devices/{id}/status  │
  ├─ Diag piggyback (auto) ────► POST /api/devices/{id}/diag    │
  │                               │ ├─ Cache in memory            │
  │                               │ ├─ Log anomalies as events    │
  │                               │ └─ Aggregate fleet health     │
  │                               │                               │
  │  GET /api/diag (local) ◄──── │ Poll via FleetBridge          │
  │                               │ GET /api/fleet/diagnostics ──► Fleet health view
  │                               │ GET /api/fleet/anomalies ───► Anomaly dashboard
  │                               │ GET /api/devices/{id}/diag ─► Per-node detail
```

**Two paths for diagnostic data:**
1. **Push (primary)**: Each heartbeat tick also POSTs the full diag report to
   `/api/devices/{id}/diag`. Zero additional polling overhead.
2. **Pull (fallback)**: FleetBridge in tritium-sc polls each node's local
   `/api/diag` endpoint directly for real-time data when server aggregation
   isn't available.

### Serial Commands

| Command | Response |
|---------|----------|
| `DIAG` | Full JSON diagnostic report |
| `HEALTH` | Current health snapshot as JSON |
| `ANOMALIES` | Active anomalies as JSON |

### Web API Endpoints (Per-Node)

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/diag` | Full diagnostic report (health + events + anomalies) |
| `GET /api/logs` | Recent log entries from ring buffer |
| `GET /api/status` | Quick status (uptime, heap, RSSI) |

### Fleet Server Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `POST /api/devices/{id}/diag` | Device submits diagnostic report (piggybacked on heartbeat) |
| `GET /api/devices/{id}/diag` | Get latest diagnostic report for a specific node |
| `GET /api/fleet/diagnostics` | Fleet-wide health overview — total nodes, critical/stale detection |
| `GET /api/fleet/anomalies` | All anomalies across fleet, sorted by severity, filterable |
| `GET /api/fleet/health` | Fleet health score (0.0-1.0) from online ratio, RSSI, heap |

### Fleet-Level Diagnostics

The fleet server aggregates diagnostic reports from all nodes to detect
cross-fleet patterns:

- **Infrastructure issues**: Multiple nodes in same area losing WiFi = router
  problem, not node problem
- **Batch defects**: All boards of same type showing I2C errors = hardware
  revision issue
- **Environmental**: Temperature spikes across nearby nodes = ambient issue
- **Firmware bugs**: Memory leak appearing after OTA on specific firmware version

### SD Card Logging

When an SD card is present, diagnostics are persisted as newline-delimited JSON:

```
/tritium/diag/20260307.jsonl    ← One file per day
/tritium/diag/20260306.jsonl
```

Each line is a timestamped event, health snapshot, or anomaly. This enables
post-mortem analysis of failures that occurred while the node was offline.

## 7. Remote Configuration

### Profile Cascade

Configuration follows a three-level cascade with later levels overriding
earlier ones:

```
Level 1: System Defaults (hardcoded in firmware)
    |
    v
Level 2: Profile Defaults (product profile default_config)
    |
    v
Level 3: Device Overrides (per-device config set by admin)
    |
    v
Effective desired_config = merge(Level 2, Level 3)
```

The firmware always has sane system defaults compiled in. The server only
sends `desired_config` when it differs from `reported_config`, minimizing
heartbeat payload size.

### Module Management

Each HAL module can be enabled or disabled remotely via the
`enabled_modules` config key. The firmware checks this list at boot and on
config update, initializing or shutting down modules accordingly.

| Module | HAL Library | Boards | Description |
|--------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| `wifi` | hal_wifi | All | Multi-network WiFi with NVS |
| `display` | display_init | All | LovyanGFX display driver |
| `touch` | hal_touch | Most | Touch input |
| `imu` | hal_imu | 3.5B-C | QMI8658 accelerometer/gyroscope |
| `power` | hal_power | 3.5B-C | AXP2101 PMIC monitoring |
| `rtc` | hal_rtc | 3.5B-C | PCF85063 real-time clock |
| `camera` | hal_camera | 3.5B-C | OV5640 DVP camera |
| `audio` | hal_audio | 3.5B-C | ES8311 codec + I2S |
| `sdcard` | hal_sdcard | 3.5B-C | SDMMC storage |
| `espnow` | hal_espnow | All | ESP-NOW mesh networking |
| `mqtt` | hal_mqtt | All | MQTT client |
| `ble` | hal_ble | All | BLE connectivity |
| `ntp` | hal_ntp | All | NTP time synchronization |
| `sleep` | hal_sleep | All | Power management |
| `watchdog` | hal_watchdog | All | Task watchdog + heap metrics |

### Configurable Settings

| Category | Keys | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Network | `wifi_networks`, `mqtt_broker`, `mqtt_port`, `server_url` | Connectivity targets |
| Time | `ntp_server`, `timezone`, `heartbeat_interval_s` | Time sync and reporting |
| Display | `display_brightness`, `display_timeout_s`, `default_app` | Visual settings |
| Power | `sleep_schedule`, `sleep_mode`, `wake_sources` | Power management |
| GPIO | `gpio_config` (array of `{pin, mode, value}`) | Remote pin control |

## 8. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Modularize

Decompose `server/fleet_server.py` (current monolith) into the `src/app/`
package structure.

| Task | Source | Target |
|------|--------|--------|
| FleetStore class | `fleet_server.py:74-179` | `src/app/store/fleet_store.py` |
| Device endpoints | `fleet_server.py` `/api/devices/*` | `src/app/routers/devices.py` |
| Firmware endpoints | `fleet_server.py` `/api/firmware/*` | `src/app/routers/firmware.py` |
| OTA endpoints | `fleet_server.py` `/api/ota/*` | `src/app/routers/firmware.py` |
| Commission endpoints | `fleet_server.py` `/api/commission/*` | `src/app/routers/devices.py` |
| OTA header parser | `fleet_server.py:49-64` | `src/app/services/ota_service.py` |
| API key middleware | `fleet_server.py` | `src/app/auth/middleware.py` |
| Pydantic settings | CLI argparse | `src/app/config.py` |
| Entry point | `fleet_server.py` top-level | `src/app/main.py` |
| Admin HTML | `server/templates/admin.html` | `src/frontend/admin.html` |

**Deliverable**: Same functionality, modular codebase, Pydantic config,
loguru logging.

### Phase 2: Auth

Add JWT authentication alongside the existing API key system.

- `src/app/auth/jwt.py`: Token creation, validation, refresh rotation.
- `src/app/auth/rbac.py`: Role definitions, permission checks.
- `src/app/auth/middleware.py`: Dual-mode auth (JWT primary, API key fallback).
- `src/app/routers/users.py`: Login, register, refresh, change password.
- Password hashing with bcrypt.
- Admin panel login page with token storage.

**Deliverable**: JWT login flow, API key still works, no breaking changes.

### Phase 3: Multi-Tenant

Add organization scoping to all data and endpoints.

- `src/app/routers/orgs.py`: Org CRUD, member management.
- `src/app/store/org_store.py`: Org-scoped directory layout under `data/orgs/`.
- Data migration script: flat `fleet_data/` to `data/orgs/default/`.
- All device, firmware, and event queries scoped to the requesting user's org.
- Org switcher in admin portal header.

**Deliverable**: Full multi-tenant isolation, default org for migration.

### Phase 4: Profiles and Config

Add product profiles and configuration management.

- `src/app/routers/profiles.py`: Profile CRUD.
- `src/app/services/config_service.py`: Config merge, drift detection.
- Heartbeat v2 request/response with `reported_config` and `desired_config`.
- Firmware changes: add `reported_config` to heartbeat payload, apply
  `desired_config` from response.
- Profile management page in admin portal.

**Deliverable**: Remote configuration with drift detection.

### Phase 5: Commands

Add remote command queue and GPIO control.

- `src/app/routers/commands.py`: Issue commands, view queue, ack status.
- `src/app/services/command_service.py`: Queue management, timeout, retry.
- Firmware changes: parse `pending_commands` from heartbeat response,
  execute, report results.
- Command panel in admin device detail view.

**Deliverable**: Remote reboot, GPIO control, diagnostics.

### Phase 6: Polish

Production readiness, testing, and UI refinement.

- Full test suite: unit, integration, e2e (Playwright).
- CYBERCORE UI redesign of admin portal.
- WebSocket real-time dashboard updates.
- Documentation: all docs/ specs written and reviewed.
- `scripts/start.sh`, `scripts/setup.sh`, `scripts/test.sh` entry points.
- `pyproject.toml` packaging.

**Deliverable**: Production-ready management platform.

## 9. Migration Strategy

### Server Code

```
BEFORE:  server/fleet_server.py (1 file, ~800 lines)
AFTER:   src/app/ (modular package, ~15 files)

Transition: server/ directory preserved during migration.
            New src/app/ imports from store/ and services/.
            fleet_server.py kept as compatibility shim until cutover.
```

### Data Directory

```
BEFORE:  fleet_data/
           devices/*.json
           firmware/*.json + .ota
           certs/<device_id>/
           events/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl
           .api_key

AFTER:   data/
           .api_key
           users/*.json
           orgs/
             {org_id}/
               org.json
               devices/*.json
               firmware/*.json + .ota
               config/profiles/*.json
               events/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl
               certs/<device_id>/
```

A one-time migration script moves existing data into `data/orgs/default/`,
creating a `default` org with all current devices and firmware. Existing
API keys continue to work with super_admin scope.

### Auth Migration

```
Phase 1: API key only (current behavior)
Phase 2: JWT added, API key still accepted (dual-mode)
Phase 3: API key deprecated (log warnings)
Phase 4: API key removed (future, not in initial roadmap)
```

### Firmware Changes

The firmware heartbeat payload requires minimal changes:

| Field | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `reported_config` | New | Device reports its active configuration |
| `module_status` | New | Per-module health status |
| All existing fields | Unchanged | version, board, ip, mac, etc. |

The heartbeat response gains new optional fields:

| Field | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `desired_config` | New | Only present when drift detected |
| `pending_commands` | New | Only present when commands queued |
| `ota` | Unchanged | Same OTA directive format |

Devices that do not send `reported_config` or process `desired_config`
continue to work -- the server simply skips config sync for them.
